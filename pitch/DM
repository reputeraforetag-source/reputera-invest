Subject / DM: AI-driven Social Proof Platform for SMBs

Hi [Investor Name],

I’m building Reputera, an AI-driven platform that automatically transforms customer feedback and reviews into measurable conversion and revenue for SMBs.

The product is fully built, with team and GitHub stack in place. We’re solving a clear problem: SMBs are losing revenue despite good reviews, because existing tools are passive and disconnected from real business outcomes. Reputera turns feedback into actionable social proof and higher conversions, not just reputation management.

I’m currently seeking perspective from investors with experience in SaaS and pre-seed funding. Capital is secondary at this stage; insight and guidance are the priority.

I’d love to share a concise one-page brief if relevant, and discuss how Reputera can scale quickly in a market eager for AI-driven conversion tools.

Best regards,
Pierre A. Camilo
