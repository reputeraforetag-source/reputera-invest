## Problem
Small and medium businesses (SMBs) lose daily conversion and revenue despite positive customer reviews. Feedback is scattered, passive, and underutilized. Platforms like Google and Trustpilot control the narrative, while businesses lack tools to **actively convert social proof into measurable business results**.

---

## Solution
Reputera is an **AI-driven system that automatically transforms customer feedback and reviews into measurable conversion**.

The platform collects, analyzes, and activates feedback through:
- AI-based sentiment and context analysis  
- Automated feedback loops  
- Dynamic social proof at the right moment in the customer journey  

Goal: not just “reputation management,” but **increased sales, higher trust, and better retention**.
