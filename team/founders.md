## **🟢 Why I'm Building Reputera**
> "I've spent years in sales and customer-facing roles. I've seen Swedish small businesses lose customers because of silent satisfaction and vocal dissatisfaction. Reputera isn't just a tech project—it's solving a revenue problem I understand firsthand."

**The Problem I Lived:**
- Happy customers don't speak up
- Unhappy customers damage businesses
- Small business owners are experts in their craft, not digital marketing

**My Solution Approach:**
Combine **sales mindset + AI tools** to create systems that:
1. Automate what businesses hate doing
2. Generate measurable revenue impact
3. Are built specifically for the Swedish market

## **🟢 Technical Expertise**
### **AI-First Development Stack**
My approach is building with modern AI tools, not traditional coding:

#### **🏗️ Production Stack (What I Actually Use)**
- **Frontend:** WordPress 6.x + Custom PHP plugins + Bootstrap 5
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL 15) + Edge Functions (TypeScript)
- **AI Orchestration:** Claude API + DeepSeek API (intelligent routing)
- **Communication:** 46elks (Swedish SMS) + Custom email providers
- **Database:** Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant isolation
- **DevOps:** Environment-based configuration + Cost tracking per tenant

#### **🔧 Real Skills (Not Buzzwords)**
- **AI-Prompt Engineering:** Building production systems with AI tools as primary development environment
- **Full-Stack System Design:** From customer interaction to database to AI response - complete workflows
- **API Integration & Automation:** Connecting multiple services into seamless customer experiences
- **GDPR-Compliant Architecture:** Built data protection into system design from day one
- **SMB-Focused UX:** Creating interfaces simple enough for craftsmen to use effectively

## **🟢 Founder Philosophy**

### **🎯 Product Principles**
- **Solve visible pain:** Don't guess what customers need—listen to what they complain about
- **Revenue over vanity:** Every feature must connect to customer acquisition, retention, or expansion
- **Start Swedish, think Swedish:** Build for the Swedish market first, with Swedish providers and SEK pricing
- **Transparency as feature:** Open build logs, clear pricing, no hidden costs

### **👥 How I Lead**
- **Hands-on building:** I don't manage from PowerPoint—I'm in the code, talking to customers, sending the invoices
- **Metric-driven decisions:** If we can't measure it, we shouldn't build it
- **Customer-obsessed development:** Weekly check-ins with real users, not annual surveys
- **Resourceful execution:** Bootstrap first, spend only when it directly generates revenue

### **🚀 Growth Mindset**
- **Learn publicly:** My mistakes are documented in GitHub for others to learn from
- **Speed beats perfection:** Launch, measure, iterate—not plan for years
- **Sustainable scaling:** Grow at the pace our customers need, not VC pressure
- **Balance pragmatism with vision:** Fix today's problems while building for tomorrow

## **🟢 Personal Motivation**
### **❤️ Why This Matters to Me**
"My journey hasn't been traditional tech—it's been sales, consulting, creative work, and seeing businesses struggle. I've sat with workshop owners watching their phones not ring because of one bad review. I've seen amazing craftsmen lose contracts to inferior competitors with better Google ratings. This isn't abstract—it's people's livelihoods."

### **🎯 What Success Looks Like**
"Success isn't a billion-dollar exit. It's seeing Swedish craftsmen, clinics, and small businesses thrive because they control their online reputation. It's building a sustainable company that employs people here in Stockholm. It's creating tools that actually help, not just look impressive on a tech blog."

### **⚡ Why Now**
"The tools exist, the market needs it, and the timing is perfect. Swedish businesses are digitally ready but underserved. AI makes complex automation affordable. I have the right combination of customer understanding and technical ability to make this work. And I'm willing to put in the years to build it right."
