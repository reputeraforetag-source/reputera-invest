🟢 Professional Background
AI-Native Product Builder & Revenue-First Founder

Core Identity:
I build revenue-generating systems using AI as my primary development tool. My background combines sales execution with AI-first product development—focusing on solving real business problems, not just writing code.

Entrepreneurial Journey:

Period	Role	Key Achievement
2024–Present	Founder @ Reputera	Built complete AI-driven SaaS platform solo for Swedish SMBs
2023–Present	Founder @ StudioShare	Created platform for renting music/podcast studios
2021–2024	Business Dev Manager @ Order Tiger	Led sales teams, exceeded targets in B2B environment
2020–2024	Founder @ Ramsteen & Crest Consulting	Business consulting with growth strategy focus
2007–2019	Creative & Event Roles	Music curation, fashion editing, event management

🟢 Why I'm Building Reputera
"I've spent years in sales and customer-facing roles. I've seen Swedish small businesses lose customers because of silent satisfaction and vocal dissatisfaction. Reputera isn't just a tech project—it's solving a revenue problem I understand firsthand."

The Problem I Lived:

Happy customers don't speak up

Unhappy customers damage businesses

Small business owners are experts in their craft, not digital marketing

My Solution Approach:
Combine sales mindset + AI tools to create systems that:

Automate what businesses hate doing

Generate measurable revenue impact

Are built specifically for the Swedish market

🟢 Technical Philosophy
Development Methodology
yaml
approach: "AI-First, Not Code-First"

focus: "Solve Customer Problems → Measure Results → Iterate"
Tech Stack (Real, Production)
Layer	Technology	Why This Choice
Frontend	WordPress 6.x + Custom PHP	Fast iteration, familiar for users
Backend	Supabase (PostgreSQL)	Real-time, secure, multi-tenant ready
